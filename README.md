# Blood Glucose Level Prediction as Time-Series Modeling using Seq-to-Seq Neural Networks

The repository holds the notebooks and code for BGLP Challenge-II at ECAI 2020. The challenge is to predict blood glucose levels of 6 patients provided their CGM (Continous Glucose Monitoring) Levels, Finger Stick values, and other values such as exercise, meal types, etc.

We have experimented with 6 different deep learning models - LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, TCN (Temporal Convolutional Networks), Seq-to-Seq Models, and Transfer Learning. Seq-to-Seq BiLSTM model proved to the best model. The repo provides code (IPython Notebooks) for all the models executed and the code used to convert the provided XML files to CSV files. The research paper corresponding to the repository has been submitted to ECAI.
